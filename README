A little hacky code to visualize drive times from multiple locations in Google Earth.  Great for choosing places to live within a given commute distance.

1) Modify the code to enter a) the geo coordinates of three locations you care about and b) the area that you want to search within
2) Run getDirections.rb to grab drive times from a grid of points within that area
3) run createXML.rb to transform that list of coordinates/times into a KML file that can be loaded into Google Earth.
